# Aogami
Aogami is a **Shin Megami Tensei V** save editor.

# Features
- Edit player's first name and last name.
- Edit play time, date saved, Macca and Glory.
- Edit player experience and level.
- Edit items.
- Export/import decrypted save data. You can use it to make your changes using a Hex Editor, for example.

# Planned features
- Edit demons.

# More stuff
This won't be a large and advanced save editor like the last one I made, [Scramble](https://github.com/supremetakoyaki/Scramble).
I made this in a few days so I hope it is useful to you. Please report to me any bugs you may find.
