# Aogami
Aogami is a **Shin Megami Tensei V** save editor.

# Features
- Edit player's first name and last name.
- Edit play time, date saved, difficulty, Macca and Glory.
- Edit Nahobino experience, level and stats.
- Edit items (includes usable items, essences, relics and important items)
- Export/import your save data in decrypted form. You can use it to make your changes using a Hex Editor, for example.

# Planned features
- Edit demons and skills.

# More stuff
This won't be a large and advanced save editor like the last one I made, [Scramble](https://github.com/supremetakoyaki/Scramble).
I hope Aogami is useful to you. Please report to me any bugs you may find.
